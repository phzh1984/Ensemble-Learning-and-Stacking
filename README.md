# Ensemble-Learning-and-Stacking

Introduction:

This repository serves as a comprehensive introduction to the concepts of ensemble learning and stacking in machine learning. The primary focus is on leveraging the strengths of multiple models to enhance predictive performance. 

Ensembling and stacking are techniques used in machine learning to improve predictive performance by combining the strengths of multiple models.

Ensembling: Ensembling involves combining predictions from multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate prediction. There are two primary types of ensembling:

•	Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): This technique involves training multiple instances of the same model on different subsets of the training data (bootstrap samples) and then combining their predictions. Random Forest is an example of a bagging ensemble method.

•	Boosting: Boosting builds multiple models sequentially, with each model attempting to correct the errors made by its predecessor. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and AdaBoost are popular boosting algorithms.

•	Voting: It combines predictions from multiple different models and makes a final prediction based on the aggregated results (e.g., using majority voting for classification or averaging for regression).

Stacking (Stacked Generalization): Stacking involves training multiple diverse models (base models) on the dataset and then combining their predictions using a meta-model (or a blender) to make the final prediction. Instead of using simple averaging or voting, stacking learns how to best combine the predictions of the base models to improve overall performance.

Workflow:

•	Train multiple base models on the training data.

•	Make predictions using these base models on a validation set (not used during their training).

•	Use these predictions as new features and feed them into a meta-model.

•	The meta-model learns to combine the predictions of the base models to generate a final prediction.

Ensembling and stacking both aim to reduce overfitting, improve prediction accuracy, and create more robust models by leveraging the strengths of diverse models or multiple variations of the same model.
